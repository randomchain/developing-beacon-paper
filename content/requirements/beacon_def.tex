\section{Beacon Definition}

\mtjnote{THIS IS DIRECTLY FROM PREVIOUS SEMESTER}

%A randomness beacon is a service that publishes random data at a known interval.
\enquote{Formally, let $B: f(I_t) \rightarrow O_t$, where $B$ is a beacon, $I_t$ is the input at time $t$, $O_t$ is the output at time $t$, and $f$ is a suitable function for transforming the input to the output.
For $B$ to be a beacon, it is run at a known, regular interval, $\delta$, such that $t+n\delta$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are valid output intervals for the beacon.
In \Vref{fig:abstract_beacon} an example of an abstract beacon can be seen.
The green area is what can be defined as the beacon, or \emph{beacon protocol} --- i.e.\ how input is collected, transformed to output and then published.}

%A sufficiently general randomness beacon with enough entropy can be utilized for multiple use cases, and as such is of higher usefulness.
%Given the many use cases, we will therefore prioritize a use case agnostic beacon.

\subsection{Trust Assumptions}

We take the view of \enquote{Everybody, including the beacon operator, is secretly colluding against you and willing to put an unlimited amount of money towards manipulating or biasing the process for their own benefit}.
The only one you can trust is yourself.
