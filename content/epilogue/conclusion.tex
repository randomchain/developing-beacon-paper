\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have identified and worked to bridge a gap in the literature of random beacons - the implementation of a working verifiable randomness beacon. In addition, we have performed a security analysis of the randomness beacon to identify threats towards them, and incorporated counters for them in the design.

Based around paralellized delay functions in a service oriented architecture, we have implemented a functioning verifiable randomness beacon. The beacon design was influenced by examples from the literature as well as our threat analysis.

We have also explored the applications of our randomness beacon as a cryptographic primitive in a variety of use cases. As such we have made great strides towards bridging the existing gap in the literature towards a practical beacon implementation.
