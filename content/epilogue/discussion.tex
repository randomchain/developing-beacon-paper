\section{Discussion}%
\label{sec:discussion}
Here will be discussions.

\mtjnote{Discuss if we could implement a memory-hard hashing algorithm, and what implications this would have.}

\mtjnote{Discuss salting: If a salt is added, it makes it easier for the operator to withhold the output. On the other hand, we can guarantee that the operator is the only one capable of doing the computations. To mitigate the withholding attacks, you could publish a timed commitment.}
