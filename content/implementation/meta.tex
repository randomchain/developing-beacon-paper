\section{Implementation}%
\label{sec:implementation}

\stefan{Somewhere there should some class diagrams etc. showing more concretely what you implemented (can be in appendix)}
In this section we present the general idea behind the implementation of our beacon design, technologies used in said implementation, and a discussion of implementation details which affect the beacon protocol.
We seek to realize the design introduced in \cref{sec:design} while making reasonable trade-offs where necessary.
This means that some parts of the implementation will be seen as future work, in the interest of time.
However, the implemented beacon will be a functional \gls{poc}, with an underlying infrastructure suitable for real world deployment and usage, and as such a good infrastructure is something we will prioritize.

% Not focus on outlets and usability applications (e.g. tracking your input from start to finish)
In the implementation of the beacon, we choose not to focus on usability applications, such as allowing a user to track their input automatically through the beacon.
Instead, we implement a beacon with simple, secure, and succinct operation.
It collects inputs, processes these inputs, does some computation, and lastly outputs data through a set of outlets.
These steps will be further elaborated in the following sections.
