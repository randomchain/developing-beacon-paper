\section{Implementation}%
\label{sec:implementation}

In this section we present the general idea behind the implementation of our beacon design, technologies used in said implementation, and a discussion of implementation details which affect the beacon protocol.
We seek to realize the design introduced in \cref{sec:design} while making reasonable trade-offs where necessary.
This means that some parts of the implementation will be seen as future work, in the interest of time.
However, the implemented beacon will be a functional \gls{poc}, with an underlying infrastructure suitable for real world deployment and usage, and as such a good infrastructure is something we will prioritize.

In the implementation of the beacon, we choose not to focus on usability applications, such as allowing a user to track their input automatically through the beacon.
Instead, we implement a beacon with simple, secure, and succinct operation.

For some concrete details about the implementation beacon, including the file structure, see \vref{app:beacon_code}.
