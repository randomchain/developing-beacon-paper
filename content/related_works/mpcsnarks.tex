\subsection{Scalable Multi-party Computation for zk-SNARK Parameters in the Random Beacon Model}
\label{sub:scalable_mpc_zk_snarks}
\citet{mpcsnarks} use a beacon as a tool for bootstrapping a system of \gls{ZK-SNARK}s. Using  \gls{MPC} based around a beacon, they can scale a bootstrapping protocol to include a much greater number of participants. Previous protocols have been limited to a handful of participants \cite{snarkparameters}.
