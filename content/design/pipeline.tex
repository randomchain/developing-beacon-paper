\subsection{Pipeline}%
\label{sub:pipeline}
In our beacon, as illustrated in \cref{fig:beacon_arch}, data only flows one way through the system and each component performs an independent transformation.
This effectively means that a beacon is a \emph{pipeline} where data flows into the system as inputs, is processed, transformed to a random output, and lastly published.

The pipeline architecture can be seen as a specialization of the \gls{soa} pattern, since each step in the pipeline is a service as defined in a \gls{soa}. When considering the system as a pipeline some restrictions are imposed compared to the more generic \gls{soa}, because data only flows in one direction. \mtjnote{We should probably elaborate on what these restrictions mean for us!}
