\subsection{Components of a Beacon}%
\label{sub:components_of_a_beacon}

In the \gls{soa}, a single instance of a randomness beacon will consist of the following (see \cref{fig:beacon_arch}):
\begin{description}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item[Input Collector Services]\hfill \\ which collect from a myriad of different sources.
    \item[Input Processing Service]\hfill \\ which aggregates the input from all the collectors.
    \item[Computation Service]\hfill \\ which commits to the aggregated input, runs the computation to generate an output.
    \item[Publishing Services]\hfill \\ which publishes the commitment, output, and any relevant proofs to different outlets.
\end{description}
