\subsection{Components of a Beacon}%
\label{sub:components_of_a_beacon}

In the \gls{soa}, a single instance of a randomness beacon will consist of a number of services. \cref{fig:beacon_arch} illustrates these services.

The \textsc{input collectors} collect input from a myriad of different sources. These sources could for example be email, irc, tweets with a specific hashtag, raw TCP or HTTP connections, a pretty website, SMS, Morse telegraph, or a bot for your favorite messaging service.
The \textsc{input processor} aggregates the input from all collectors and hands it over to the \textsc{computation service}, which commits to the aggregated input and runs the computation to generate a pseudorandom output.
Finally, various \textsc{publishers} publish the commitment, output, and any relevant proofs to different outlets. These outlets could be the same media as input collectors use.
