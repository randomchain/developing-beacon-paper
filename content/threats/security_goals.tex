\subsection{Security Goals}
This section concerns the security goals that we have for our beacon design and implementation, which in turn will shape the requirements to the system. 

\begin{description}
    \item [Trust] Users should only need to trust themselves. The output of the beacon must be impossible to bias against a user that has successfully contributed to it. 
    \item [Byzantine Behavior Detection] If the beacon deviates from protocol, it should be easily detectable.  
    \item [Fault Isolation] If a component acts byzantine, the behavior should not propagate to the rest of the system. 
    \item [Availability] The beacon should have a variety of input and output options for both usability and redundancy. 
\end{description}
