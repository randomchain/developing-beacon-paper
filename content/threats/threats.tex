\section{Threat Analysis}
We now turn to considering possible threats to a generic randomness beacon in order to understand the surrounding environment.
These threats assume the \emph{user input} model of input as well as a beacon based on the \emph{transparent authority} model.

Randomness is the fundamental resource that adversaries would attempt to threaten and control.
It is considered and used as a fair determinant, and adversaries can seize control of it to control the outcomes it is used to determine.
Once in control of the randomness, an adversary can bias it towards their own benefit, ensuring that otherwise fair outcomes will consistently favor them.
Alternatively, an adversary colluding against a user will only have to make sure the randomness is either biased against or not available to that user.
