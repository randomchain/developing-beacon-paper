\subsection{The Effect of Verifiability}
One of the requirements of the beacon is verifiability, both of input and computation. This means that while many of the previously threats could indeed happen, the adversary would very likely be caught in the act. This means that a corrupt operator would rapidly be caught acting maliciously, which could lead to the creation of a new beacon.
