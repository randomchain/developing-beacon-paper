\section{Applied Use Cases}
To demonstrate the usefulness of a randomness beacon we present a series of use cases related to our beacon.
The fundamental use case of a beacon is to generate randomness that multiple parties can agree is not biased to anyone's advantage or disadvantage.

The beacon can be thought of as a cryptographic primitive that can be used to obtain secure randomness. Users can then structure their use of the beacon in a way to fit their specific application of randomness. Conducting these ceremonies is critical to properly applying the randomness produced by our beacon.

Thus we present not just the use cases, but how the beacon can be used to provide secure randomness for a given use case.
