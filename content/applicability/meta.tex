\section{Applied Use Cases}
\mtjnote{Rewrite: This section should be how our beacon fits in all the use cases of the introduction. Instantiating the beacon in different contexts.}
\mtjnote{This entire section uses the word \enquote{trustless}! I do not think we have defined it or even used it before. Either define now (would be weird) or rewrite.}

There are a multitude of applications for the beacon we have designed and implemented, some of which we cover in this section. We will also describe exactly how the beacon should be used to be as secure as possible.

Fundamentally, the beacon can be thought of as a cryptographic primitive that can be used to obtain secure randomness. Users can then structure their use of the beacon in such a way to fit their specific application of randomness. Conducting these ceremonies is critical to properly applying the randomness produced by our beacon.
