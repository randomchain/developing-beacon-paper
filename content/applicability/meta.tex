\section{Applications}
There are a multitude of applications for the beacon we have designed and implemented, some of which we cover in this section. We will also describe exactly how the beacon should be used to be as secure possible.

Fundamentally, the beacon can be thought of as a cryptographic primitive, that can be used to obtain secure randomness. Users can then structure their use of the beacon in such a way to fit their specific application of randomness. Conducting these ceremonies is critical to properly applying the randomness produced by our beacon.
