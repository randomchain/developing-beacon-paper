\subsection{Users}
It is useful to consider what type of users, the beacon may be useful to. In general, the beacon can be by any type of multitude that desire to use transparent randomness. The best fit for this is trustless applications, where parties can be expected to cheat if it would benefit them.

A beacon is not needed for any single party, as they could simply generate their randomness themselves. It is the need for multiple parties to agree on something random that creates the need for public randomness.

In addition, it is not needed for a setting with trust between the parties, as they could then simply trust each other to generate randomness. In trust-less settings this is not an option, and so users need randomness they can trust not to be biased, or at least detect if it is.

This is where our beacon finds it's niche of applications.
