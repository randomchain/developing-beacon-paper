\subsection{Scalable Multi-party Computation for zk-SNARK Parameters in the Random Beacon Model}%
\label{sub:scalable_mpc_zk_snarks}
\citet{mpcsnarks} use a beacon as a tool for bootstrapping a system of \gls{zksnark}.
Using \gls{mpc} protocol based around a beacon, they scale a bootstrapping protocol to include a much greater number of participants.
Previous protocols have been limited to a handful of participants~\cite{snarkparameters}. They have also been characterized by long and highly complex bootstrapping ceremonies.
