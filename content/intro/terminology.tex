\subsection{Terminology}
In this work we use the terms \enquote{randomness beacon} and \enquote{beacon} interchangeably.
As presented, we see two distinct groups of randomness beacons: the ones requiring users to blindly trust the beacon operator (Ã  la Rabin's original beacon), which we refer to as \emph{trust-requiring} beacons; and the \enquote{new generation} randomness beacons of recent literature, which convincingly prove to all users of the beacon that nothing dubious happened during the creation of the random output --- these are referred to as \emph{trust-minimizing} beacons.
