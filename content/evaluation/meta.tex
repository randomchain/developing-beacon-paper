\section{Performance Evaluation}
One way of evaluation our beacon, is to examine the performance of key part of it.
In this section we explore the performance of potential system bottlenecks, to gauge reasonable throughput.
We also investigate our chosen delay function \textit{sloth}, and different configurations of it.

All tests are executed on a server with an \textit{Intel Core i7-2600}~CPU, which runs at $3.40$~GHz and has 4 cores as well as hyper-threading.
We use \textit{SHA512} as the underlying hashing algorithm in both the Merkle tree, and in the \textit{sloth} delay function.
