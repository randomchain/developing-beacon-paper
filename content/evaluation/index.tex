\section{Performance Evaluation}
\mtjnote{Some meta text}

All tests are executed on a server with an \textit{Intel Core i7-2600}~CPU, which runs at $3.40$~GHz and has 4 cores as well as hyper-threading.
We use \textit{SHA512} as the hashing algorithm in both the Merkle tree, and in the \textit{sloth} delay function.

\label{sub:bottlenecks}

\msmnote{Test bottlenecks and show how much they can handle before scaling up is needed. E.g.\ time merkle tree building for n inputs, throughput of proxies, maybe more?}
