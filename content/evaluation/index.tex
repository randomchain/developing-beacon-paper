\section{Evaluation}
\mtjnote{Maybe we need this section? Write your ideas here:}

\mtjnote{Incentives to run the final system... Isn't this a good evaluation-thing?}

\subsection{System Design}
While we take inspiration from previous work and literature, designing a randomness beacon from ground up is no simple feat. We have designed a system which is based on simple principles. However, simple systems still have many details when considering the implementation. We have made conscious choices regarding communication framework, communication patterns, compromises between verbosity and base essentials in communication, and put much thought into the practicalities of running our beacon. In particular, we have parallelized the beacon operation to have a continuous input stream and regular output, and outline a formula for finding the number of computation nodes. Further, we scale input collecting by enabling horizontal scaling, and even improve usability of the system by allowing these input collectors to collect from a variety of sources with easy access for users.
\mtjnote{Is this more conclusion worthy?}

\subsection{Something}
\mtjnote{Eftersom vi har taget valget om at operatoren kører beacon som greater good + no money involved, så easy deploy painless}
