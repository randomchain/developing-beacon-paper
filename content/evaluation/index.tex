\section{Evaluation}

\mtjnote{\textbf{So this section should contain a review of our design and implementation --- probably with a big focus on security and scalability.}}

\mtjnote{We could probably provide the narrative of having a informal or formalized technique to do a design review. SWEBOK: \enquote{Software design reviews: informal and formalized techniques to determine the quality of design artifacts (for example, architecture reviews, design reviews, and inspections; scenario-based techniques; requirements tracing). \textbf{Software design reviews can also evaluate security}.}}
