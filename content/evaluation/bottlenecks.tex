\subsubsection{Input Processor --- Building Merkle Trees}%
\label{ssub:input_processor_building_merkle_trees}
The most expensive task performed in a bottleneck, is building the Merkle tree in our input processor.
This task is done periodically when it is time to compute a new random output.
It should not take a significant amount of time, since this would extend the time between the last seen input and publishing the commit.
As such, we examine how the number of leaves, i.e.\ inputs, relates to the time it takes to build the Merkle tree.

In \cref{fig:merkle_build}, a linear growth in build time is seen as a factor of the number of leaves.
The growth is slow and is negligible in our beacon. There needs to be well over 2 million leaves to result in a build time over three seconds.
We can describe the relationship as follows, where $N$ is the number of leaves:
$$
1.41\,\mu\text{s} \cdot N + 1.41\,\text{ms}
$$

Admittedly, the build time could be a problem if significantly many inputs are used.
However, in this case one might reimplement the input processor in a more performant language than Python, e.g.\ C.
In addition, the construction of Merkle trees is trivially parallized. Our implementation of Merkle trees does not take advantage of this fact, and so building subtrees in multiple processes and merging them to form the final tree will likely provide a significant speed-up with a factor close to the number of cores.
